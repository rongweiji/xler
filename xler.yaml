# Robot dimensions (2D footprint in meters)
# NOTE: Arrow points along the SHORTER dimension
# The LONGER dimension is the "front" of the robot
width: 0.3    # 0.3m = 300mm (shorter side, arrow points this way)
length: 0.4   # 0.4m = 400mm (longer side, this is the front)

# Robot orientation visualization
# The arrow shows the forward direction of the robot
# Arrow is ALWAYS perpendicular to the LONGER side (length)
# Arrow is ALWAYS parallel to the SHORTER side (width)
# This means: the length side defines the "front" of the robot
orientation:
  arrow_length_ratio: 0.7    # Arrow length as ratio of width (0.5-1.0)
